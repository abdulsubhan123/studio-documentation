## Solutions

Solutions are used to transport apps and components from one environment to another or to apply a set of customizations to existing apps. A solution can contain one or more apps as well as other components such as site maps, tables, processes, web resources, choices, flows, and more.

Solutions are the mechanism for implementing application lifecycle management (ALM) in Power Apps and other Power Platform products, such as Power Automate. For detailed information about the solution concepts and how solutions are used for application lifecycle management, see Overview of ALM with Microsoft Power Platform in the Power Platform ALM guide.
